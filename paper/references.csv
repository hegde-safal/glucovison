"Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction","Machine learning can provide personalized diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction, but methodological standards are needed to overcome challenges and ensure efficacy and safety.","E. Oikonomou, Rohan Khera",2023,93,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving a paradigm shift in medicine, promising data-driven, personalized solutions for managing diabetes and the excess cardiovascular risk it poses. In this comprehensive review of machine learning applications in the care of patients with diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, we offer a broad overview of various data-driven methods and how they may be leveraged in developing predictive models for personalized care. We review existing as well as expected artificial intelligence solutions in the context of diagnosis, prognostication, phenotyping, and treatment of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. In addition to discussing the key properties of such models that enable their successful application in complex risk prediction, we define challenges that arise from their misuse and the role of methodological standards in overcoming these limitations. We also identify key issues in equity and bias mitigation in healthcare and discuss how the current regulatory framework should ensure the efficacy and safety of medical artificial intelligence products in transforming cardiovascular care and outcomes in diabetes.","","Cardiovascular Diabetology","1","10.1186/s12933-023-01985-3","https://consensus.app/papers/machine-learning-in-precision-diabetes-care-and-oikonomou-khera/5ceaccce63755a989e866563b12f40a5/"
"Machine Learning Tools for Long-Term Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction","The ensemble WeightedVotingLRRFs ML model effectively predicts long-term type 2 diabetes risk, providing a personalized approach for early detection and reduced impact on quality of life.","Nikos Fazakis, Otilia Kocsis, Elias Dritsas, Sotiris Alexiou, N. Fakotakis, K. Moustakas",2021,103,"A steady rise has been observed in the percentage of elderly people who want and are still able to contribute to society. Therefore, early retirement or exit from the labour market, due to health-related issues, poses a significant problem. Nowadays, thanks to technological advances and various data from different populations, the risk factors investigation and health issues screening are moving towards automation. In the context of this work, a worker-centric, IoT enabled unobtrusive users health, well-being and functional ability monitoring framework, empowered with AI tools, is proposed. Diabetes is a high-prevalence chronic condition with harmful consequences for the quality of life and high mortality rate for people worldwide, in both developed and developing countries. Hence, its severe impact on humans’ life, e.g., personal, social, working, can be considerably reduced if early detection is possible, but most research works in this field fail to provide a more personalized approach both in the modeling and prediction process. In this direction, our designed system concerns diabetes risk prediction in which specific components of the Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) process are applied, evaluated and incorporated. Specifically, dataset creation, features selection and classification, using different Supervised Machine Learning (ML) models are considered. The ensemble WeightedVotingLRRFs ML model is proposed to improve the prediction of diabetes, scoring an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.884. Concerning the weighted voting, the optimal weights are estimated by their corresponding Sensitivity and AUC of the ML model based on a bi-objective genetic algorithm. Also, a comparative study is presented among the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) and Leicester risk score systems and several ML models, using inductive and transductive learning. The experiments were conducted using data extracted from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) database.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/access.2021.3098691","https://consensus.app/papers/machine-learning-tools-for-longterm-type-2-diabetes-risk-fazakis-kocsis/0d5227e72e3b5cd48944aba40e93a7fa/"
"An Explainable AI Framework for Online Diabetes Risk Prediction with a Personalized Chatbot Assistant","This study proposes an explainable AI framework for predicting diabetes risk online and providing patient-specific advice through a personalized chatbot assistant, improving decision-making and diabetes risk management.","Ehesan Maimaitijiang, Muyesaier Aihaiti, Yasin Mamatjan",2025,1,"Background and Objective: Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that presents considerable health risks, making prompt diagnosis and treatment essential to avert complications. Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for diabetes prediction often operate as black boxes. A major issue caused by this is that black boxes lack interpretability, which impacts their effectiveness in clinical use cases. We introduce a novel online recommendation framework using explainable AI (XAI) to predict type II diabetes risk and provide clear, actionable analyses with a personalized chatbot assistant. Methods: To make the model, we chose the CatBoost classifier and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) due to their ability to provide accurate predictions. Using those tools, we analyzed 16 individual risk factors from a dataset of 520 patients. We applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to reduce the effect of data imbalance. We also developed an interactive interface that allows users to input data, visualize personalized risk profiles, and understand the driving factors behind predictions. Finally, large language models (LLMs) were integrated into the interface for patient-specific recommendations for improving health and lifestyle through a personalized chatbot assistant. Results: The model demonstrated great predictive performance, with an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.99, a Cohen Kappa score of 0.978, and an F1 score of 0.99. For the minority class, SMOTE application improved performance metrics, resulting in an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.91 for female patients. Conclusions: This study proposes an explainable AI framework for predicting diabetes risk online and providing patient-specific advice through a personalized chatbot assistant. This will help to facilitate better decision-making and improved management of diabetes risk.","","Electronics","4","10.3390/electronics14183738","https://consensus.app/papers/an-explainable-ai-framework-for-online-diabetes-risk-maimaitijiang-aihaiti/8e053555b48956cc96a261a926895dc8/"
"1823-LB: DiaLOG—A Personalized and Interactive Diabetes Education Platform Empowered with Risk Assessment AI Algorithms and ChatGPT","DiaLOG, an AI-powered diabetes self-management platform, enables patients with prediabetes to self-assess their risk and receive individualized self-management advice.","Jiqiao Lu, Shuya Lu, Yubo Zhao, Hilda Tsang, Daihai He, Xiang Li, Lin Yang",2024,2,"Introduction & Objective: The latest breakthrough of large language models offers a great opportunity to create personalized and interactive education tools for self-management of chronic conditions.
 Methods: In this study, we developed an individualized and interactive diabetes education platform for Chinese populations with prediabetes, which consists of three key components: 1) a dashboard with individual records; 2) the AI algorithms for individualized risk prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence that were constructed and validated with 17-year territory-wide electronic health records (EHR) in Hong Kong; 2) a Chatbot empowered by chatGPT.
 Results: We developed the clinically explainable prediction models using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, for two-, five- and ten-year risk predictions in the sub-cohorts of 187,785, 99,853 and 17,301 patients, respectively. We found the Dense Layer Neural Networks (DNN) models achieved the best performance, with the area under receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 81.1%, 79.9%, 75.03% for two-, five- and ten-year risk prediction, respectively. The most significant predictors were fasting glucose and HbA1c, followed by creatinine, age at baseline, sex, potassium, triglyceride, and HDL-C. The DNN models achieved satisfactory performance in external validation. The developed models were then integrated into a web-based prediabetes self-management platform, named DiaLOG, as part of prompt engineering for interaction with ChatGPT.
 Conclusion: Validated risk prediction models based on EHR data could be integrated into an AI-powered diabetes self-management platform, together with a ChatGPT-powered chatbot, to facilitate clinical decision and empower patients with self-risk assessments and individualized self-management advice.

"AI-Powered System for Diabetes Prediction and Personalized Recommendations","This AI-based web application uses machine learning and generative AI to predict diabetes risk and provide personalized interventions, improving healthcare outcomes.","Abhishek Cholakal",2025,0,"ABSTRACT
Machine learning along with artificial intel- ligence (AI) seem to make a paradigm shift into the healthcare domain by ensuring better diagnosis and treatment approaches. Consid- ering the Mexico’s increasing prevalence of diabetes, timely diagnosis and properly deter- mined intervention approach becomes essen- tial. This project presents a unique AI-based web application that simulates and evaluates diabetes risk in individuals with the help of machine learning and generative AI, enabling personalized health recommendations. Specif- ically, the application evaluates eight param- eters such as glucose, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc. All of the parameters will allow users to foresee the risk of diabetes and determine the appropriate response to it. Moreover, the application uses Google Gemini, a generative AI model, to provide customized diabetes in- terventions by analyzing a patient’s health data, and determines likely future health sce- narios. Such interventions relate and explain the causes of diabetes, abnormal character- istics of human health, and effective dietary and lifestyle changes. The system is built using Streamlit which allows for a graphic interface that is convenient whereby the users input health data and instantly get diagnosis and interventions. It can be inferred that there is a huge opportunity in the realm of health technology advancing in terms of better pre- ventive healthcare, which results in better patient outcomes as well as better integration of machine learning and AI.

"A Comprehensive System for Diabetes Management and Prediction Using AI-Driven Chatbot and Machine Learning Models","AI-driven chatbots and machine learning models can improve diabetes management and predict risk, providing real-time insights for informed decisions.","Swathi Buragadda, Ch. Vamsi, Mohammed Jafrin, Ajay Ramisetti",2025,0,"The integration of a chatbot with a predictive analytics model for Better Diabetes Management, powered by AI. The chatbot has been developed to answer specific user questions using Gradio and the Llama Index with the HuggingFace models in relation to the prevention, care, and management of diabetes in a personalized and evidence-based manner. It does so while making references dynamically to medical documents ingested and thereby assuring relevance in context and up-to-date grounding in medical knowledge. In parallel, the predictive model uses the Flask web application deployment of a Random Forest algorithm to evaluate the risk for diabetes based on key health metrics: glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI. Inputs are then preprocessed and scaled before analysis, which lets the model provide accurate predictions about the presence of diabetes and gives the user immediate actionable feedback. This integrated system does not only encourage interactive engagement to better understand diabetes, but also provides real-time insights for informed decisions. It is a bridge project between expert medical knowledge and available health management tools in the domain of personalized health through AI.","","2025 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","","10.1109/icict64420.2025.11004922","https://consensus.app/papers/a-comprehensive-system-for-diabetes-management-and-buragadda-vamsi/e0803a25592b5571afd6ef2326cb4e51/"

"AI-Driven Early Diabetes Prediction","AI-driven models can accurately predict early diabetes with a 75% accuracy, offering a valuable tool for healthcare providers and patients.","Devansh Sehgal, Inderdeep Kaur, Vaibhav Sharma, Bhuvnesh Gautam, Arozedeep Singh, Nishant Kumar",2024,2,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer a significant advantage in early diabetes prediction, enabling proactive healthcare interventions that can mitigate the risk of complications. In this review, we explore various AI-driven approaches to predict diabetes, focusing on a project that implemented multiple ML models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The KNN model demonstrated the best overall performance, achieving an accuracy score of 75%, as evidenced by other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, leading to its deployment in a real-world application using Flask, a lightweight web framework. This deployment allows for real-time diabetes risk assessment, offering healthcare providers and patients an accessible tool for early diabetes prediction. However, the project also identified challenges related to data quality and model bias, underscoring the importance of addressing these limitations for broader adoption of AI-driven healthcare tools. This review concludes by discussing future directions for AI in healthcare, including potential improvements to diabetes prediction models and ethical considerations. The outcomes suggest that AI can play a crucial role in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, offering a pathway toward improved patient outcomes through early detection and personalized treatment.","literature review","2024 IEEE 3rd World Conference on Applied Intelligence and Computing (AIC)","","10.1109/aic61668.2024.10730970","https://consensus.app/papers/aidriven-early-diabetes-prediction-sehgal-kaur/a6180fa3ed135335a68007aff46fbe27/"

"Genetic biomarkers and machine learning techniques for predicting diabetes: systematic review","Multimodal diabetes prediction models outperform unimodal models, with SNPs and gene expression profiles being the most used data types, but further advancements are needed to propel genomic discovery.","Sulaiman Khan, Farida Mohsen, Zubair Shah",2024,9,"Diabetes mellitus is a long-term metabolic condition marked by high blood sugar levels due to issues with insulin production, insulin effectiveness, or a combination of both. It stands as one of the fastest-growing diseases worldwide, projected to afflict 693 million adults by 2045. The escalating prevalence of diabetes and associated health complications (kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy) underscore the imperative to devise predictive models for early diagnosis and intervention. These complications contribute to increased mortality rates, blindness, kidney failure, and an overall diminished quality of life in individuals living with diabetes. While clinical risk factors and glycemic control provide valuable insights, they alone cannot reliably predict the onset of vascular complications. Genetic biomarkers and machine learning techniques have emerged as promising tools for predicting diabetes development risk and associated complications. Despite the emergence of numerous smart AI models for diabetes prediction, there is still a need for a thorough review outlining their progress and challenges. To address this gap, this paper offers a systematic review of the literature on AI-based models for diabetes identification, following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Our review revealed that multimodal diabetes prediction models outperformed unimodal models. Most studies focused on classical machine learning models, with SNPs being the most used data type, followed by gene expression profiles, while lipidomic and metabolomic data were the least utilized. Moreover, some studies focused on identifying genetic determinants of diabetes complications relied on familial linkage analysis, tailored for robust effect loci. However, these approaches had limitations, including susceptibility to false positives in candidate gene studies and underpowered AI models capabilities due to sample size constraints. The landscape shifted dramatically with the proliferation of genomic datasets, fueled by the emergence of biobanks and the amalgamation of global cohorts. This surge has led to a more than twofold increase in genetic discoveries related to both diabetes and its complications using AI. Our focus here is on these genetic breakthroughs, particularly those empowered by AI models. However, we also highlight the existing gaps in research and underscore the need for further advancements to propel genomic discovery to the next level.","systematic review","Artificial Intelligence Review","1","10.1007/s10462-024-11020-w","https://consensus.app/papers/genetic-biomarkers-and-machine-learning-techniques-for-khan-mohsen/ad908a4cef105936b42e363e020e7a78/"
